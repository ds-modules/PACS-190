    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the powerful things about text analysis with Python is the ability to work with a large number of documents simultaneously. In this notebook, we'll expand Term Frequency analysis to cover multiple text documents in a **Term Document Matrix**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term-document model is also sometimes referred to as \"bag-of-words\" by those who don't think very highly of it. The term document model looks at language as individual communicative efforts that contain one or more tokens. The kind and number of the tokens in a document tells you something about what is attempting to be communicated, and the order of those tokens is ignored. This is the primary method still used for most text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also learn another method of text analysis by **Sentiment**. We'll look at the tools to conduct sentiment analysis, and explore pros and cons to such an approach.\n",
