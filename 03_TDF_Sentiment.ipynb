    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the powerful things about text analysis with Python is the ability to work with a large number of documents simultaneously. In this module, we'll expand the bag-of-words approach to cover multiple text documents in a **Term Document Matrix**. We'll also explore another way of analysing texts by sentiment.\n",

    "# 1. Working with Multiple Documents <a id='section 1'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The term-document model is also sometimes referred to as \"bag-of-words\" by those who don't think very highly of it. The term document model looks at language as individual communicative efforts that contain one or more tokens. The kind and number of the tokens in a document tells you something about what is attempting to be communicated, and the order of those tokens is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the primary method still used for most text analysis, although models utilizing word embeddings are beginning to take hold. We will discuss word embeddings briefly at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to actually turn our text into a bag of words, we'll have to do some preprocessing. This is a crucial step at the beginning of any NLP project, and much of this first section will involve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, let's import NLTK and load some data: tweets from @realDonaldTrump. "
